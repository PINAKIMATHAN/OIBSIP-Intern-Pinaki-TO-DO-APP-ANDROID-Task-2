As an intern, I developed a functional To-Do app using Android Studio, showcasing my proficiency in Java and XML. Through this project, I honed my skills in UI/UX design and gained hands-on experience with database integration. This accomplishment highlights my ability to tackle real-world development challenges and contribute effectively to team projects as per the task of Oasis Infobyte i.e., Android App Development ----TASK-2.
